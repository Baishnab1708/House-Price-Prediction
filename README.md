📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the House Price India dataset from Kaggle, which includes various features affecting house prices such as:

Numerical features: Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Floors, etc.
Categorical features: Location, Property Type, etc.
Target variable: Price (the sale price of the house)

🕵️‍♂️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key steps in EDA included:

Analyzing the distribution of numerical and categorical features.
Identifying outliers and handling missing data.
Encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding.
Checking feature correlations with the target variable.

🧠 Modeling
Three regression algorithms were employed for predicting house prices:

Linear Regression: Provides a simple baseline model.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Captures non-linear relationships by considering the nearest data points.
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble method that reduces overfitting and boosts predictive accuracy.
Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R² Score
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
📈 Results
The Random Forest Regressor outperformed the other models, achieving the lowest error and highest R² score.

🚀 Conclusion
The project demonstrated the effectiveness of using ensemble methods like Random Forest for predicting house prices. The model captured complex relationships in the data better than simpler models like Linear Regression.

Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
Feature engineering to include additional relevant features.
Exploration of other advanced algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Gradient Boosting).
